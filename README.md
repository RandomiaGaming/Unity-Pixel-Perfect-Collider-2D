# Unity-Pixel-Perfect-Collider-2D
A simple component which generates pixel perfect colliders for 2D GameObjects within the unity game engine.  To use this component just add it to a GameObject which has a spriteRenderer component and polygonCollider2D component attatched, and it will fit the  polygonCollider2D to the sprite being displayed in the spriteRenderer component.  Note that the spriteRenderer's sprite must have read/write enabled or it will throw an error.
