# Unity2D Pixel Perfect Collider
Unity2D Pixel Perfect Collider is a simple C# script that when added to a 2D GameObject in unity will create a pixel perfect polygon collider based off of that GameObject's sprite.

Development has temporarily stopped on this project as I focus on other things. Feel free to keep using this script but just know it might not continue to work in newer versions of unity are released.
